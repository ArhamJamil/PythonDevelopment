LIST In Python :

    A list is a versatile and mutable data structure that can hold a collection of items. 
    Lists are defined using square brackets [], and the items within the list are separated by commas. 

    [ A mutable data structure is one that can be modified after its initial creation.
    in other words, you can change, add, or remove elements within a mutable data structure 
    without needing to create a completely new structure. This is in contrast to an immutable data 
    structure, which cannot be changed once it's created. ]

    Lists in Python can hold a mix of different data types, making them very flexible. 
    Additionally, Python provides a wide range of built-in functions and methods to 
    manipulate and work with lists efficiently.
